# Advanced Machine Learning Techniques Data Cleaning Random Forest MLP Classification
An end to end ML workflow including data cleaning (KNN imputation, outlier handling, MinMax scaling), feature importance evaluation, Random Forest tuning, and a refined MLP classifier for the final predictions.
This repository contains a complete Machine Learning project developed in Python for the course Advanced Machine Learning Techniques.
The project covers the full ML pipeline, including:
## Data preprocessing:
* Removal of non-informative features
* KNN-based imputation for missing values
* Outlier detection and removal using the IQR method
* Feature scaling with MinMax normalization
## Modeling and Evaluation:
* Training and hyperparameter tuning of a Random Forest Classifier
* Extraction and analysis of feature importances
* Development of an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) Classifier using the top 10 most important features
* Evaluation of model performance on training and test sets
## Final Predictions:
* Application of the optimized MLP model to the evaluation dataset
* Export of predictions to Excel
## Conclusion
* Demonstrates practical use of supervised learning
* Includes model comparison and hyperparameter optimization
* Showcases robust data preprocessing techniques
